# E-commerce-Project
During my 2nd year of university we worked on building an e-commerce website i chose to work on a shopo that sells personalized organic scened candles,
the websie is composed of a main/home page that includes a quiz that will help you personalize your scented candle, 
then the shop page which is the most important part of an e-commerce website alongside the cart and the checkout pages,
